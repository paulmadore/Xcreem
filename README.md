# Xcreem by phm.link
## based on KomodoEdit, inspired by Screem

Basically this will be a user-friendly HTML editor. Using the hull of Komodo, which is a brilliant
platform, to build out the missing functions. Will remove all things not releated to HTML or JS or
other web-friendly languages. This will not be great for PHP, which is not mark-up nor really
a necessary component of the WWW (in my opinion.)
